## Usability

### <!-- minrdocs:mapping --> – Mapping { #mapping data-toc-label="Mapping" }

Mapping utilities are meant to be used by mappers, with no scripting necessary!

### <!-- minrdocs:scripting --> – Scripting { #scripting data-toc-label="Scripting" }

Scripting utility primarily provides tools for scripts, such as utility functions or data structures.

### <!-- minrdocs:internal --> – Internal Use { #internal data-toc-label="Internal Use" }

An internal namespace, class, or function is used only within the scope of another utility, and **should not be used** in scripts or in maps directly.

## Type

### <!-- minrdocs:msc --> – msc { #msc data-toc-label="msc" }

These utilities are used in-game as a script, and written in msc.

### <!-- minrdocs:non_msc --> – non-msc { #non-msc data-toc-label="non-msc" }

These utilities use functionality external to minr, such as on a website or a downloadable program.

## Other

### <!-- minrdocs:core --> – Core { #core data-toc-label="Core" }

Core utilities are time-tested and reputable, with minimal downsides when it comes to using them. These utilities can only call functions from _other_ <!-- minrdocs:core --> utilities or themselves. They're also high-quality and worth checking out!

!!! note "Why does this exist?"

    Ideally, _every_ utility gets documented here, even if it's a first project and doesn't work 100% (heck, _especially_ if it's a first project, often new players have incredibly novel and interesting ideas and they deserve to be seen!) This tag allows the barrier of entry on these docs to stay open for everyone. 

### <!-- minrdocs:github https://github.com/github/docs --> – Github { #github data-toc-label="Github" }

This symbol denotes that a utility has a github. Click on the text to open the github repo.

### <!-- minrdocs:website https://example.com --> – Website { #website data-toc-label="Website" }

This symbol denotes that a utility has a website. Click on the text to open it.
