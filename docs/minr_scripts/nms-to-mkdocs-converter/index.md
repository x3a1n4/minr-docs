# [.nms to mkdocs Converter](https://x3a1n4.github.io/nms-to-md/)

This is a utility website that generates a documentation structure from an uploaded .nms file. 
It doesn't do *everything* automatically, but it gets pretty far.

## Features:
- Generates a file for each class called `[ClassName].md`
- Generates an `index.md` file for each namespace
- Generates a `index.md` file for the project as a whole
- Attempts to use comments above members as descriptions
- Generated folder can simply be dropped into the [Minr Player Utilities `minr_scripts` folder](https://github.com/x3a1n4/minr-docs/tree/main/docs/minr_scripts)
